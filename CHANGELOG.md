## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### New Features

- New `AppBuilder` to create a Slim App instance for different scenarios. Replaces the `AppFactory`.
- Unified DI container resolution. All the factory logic has been removed and moved to the DI container. This reduces the internal complexity by delegating the building logic into the DI container.
- Provide FIFO (first in, first out) middleware order support. FIFO is used as default but can be changed to LIFO using the AppBuilder.
- Optimized internal routing concept for better separation of concern and flexibility.
    - `RoutingMiddleware` handles the routing process.
    - `EndpointMiddleware` processes the routing results and invokes the controller/action handler.
- Simplified Error handling concept. Relates to #3287.
  - Separation of Exceptions handling, PHP Error handling and Exception logging into different middleware.
  - `ExceptionLoggingMiddleware` for custom error logging.
  - `ExceptionHandlingMiddleware` delegates exceptions to a custom error handler.
  - `ErrorHandlingMiddleware` converts errors into `ErrorException` instances that can then be handled by the `ExceptionHandlingMiddleware` and `ExceptionLoggingMiddleware`.
  - New custom error handlers using a new `ExceptionHandlerInterface`. See new `ExceptionHandlingMiddleware`.
  - New `JsonExceptionRenderer` generates a JSON problem details (rfc7807) response
  - New `XmlExceptionRenderer` generates a XML problem details (rfc7807) response
- New `BasePathMiddleware` for dealing with Apache subdirectories.
- New `HeadMethodMiddleware` ensures that the response body is empty for HEAD requests.
- New `JsonRenderer` utility class for rendering JSON responses.
- New `RequestResponseTypedArgs` invocation strategy for route parameters with type declarations.
- New `UrlGeneratorMiddleware` injects the `UrlGenerator` into the request attributes.
- Support to build a custom middleware pipeline without the Slim App class. See new `ResponseFactoryMiddleware`
- Add content negotiator
- Add Config class and ConfigInterface

### Changed

* Require PHP 8.2 or 8.3. News versions will be supported after a review and test process.
* Migrated all tests to PHPUnit 11
* Update GitHub action and build settings
* Improve DI container integration. Make the DI container a first-class citizen. Require a PSR-11 package.
* Ensure that route attributes are always in the Request. Related to #3280. See new `RoutingArgumentsMiddleware`.
* Unify `CallableResolver` and `AdvancedCallableResolver`. Resolved with the new CallableResolver. Relates to #3073.
- PSR-7 and PSR-15 compliance: Require at least psr/http-message 2.0.
- PSR-11 compliance: Require at least psr/container 2.0.
- PSR-3 compliance: Require at least psr/log 3.0
- The `App` class is not a request handler that implements the `RequestHandlerInterface` because the request handler is now used internally and must be "unique" within the DI container.

### Removed

* Router cache file support (File IO was never sufficient. PHP OpCache is much faster)
* The `$app->redirect()` method because it was not aware of the basePath. Use the `UrlGenerator` instead.
* The route `setArguments` and `setArgument` methods. Use a middleware for custom route arguments now.
* The `RouteContext::ROUTE` const. Use `$route = $request->getAttribute(RouteContext::ROUTING_RESULTS)->getRoute();` instead.
* Old tests for PHP 7
* Psalm
* phpspec/prophecy
* phpspec/prophecy-phpunit

### Fixed

- Resolving middleware breaks if resolver throws unexpected exception type #3071. Resolved with the new CallableResolver.
- Forward logger to own `ErrorHandlingMiddleware` #2943. See new `ExceptionLoggingMiddleware`.
- Code styles (PSR-12)
